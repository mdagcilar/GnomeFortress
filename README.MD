Gnome Fortress
==============

Assumptions
-----------
* The program will run until their is a lone victor or a single group remaining of multiple victorious Gnomes.
* The floor plan can be edited and different dimensions are supported. However, it is left to the
editor of the floor plan to ensure that their are no unreachable corridors.
* When Gnomes are placed randomly at the beginning of the battle, Gnomes cannot be placed on the same Tile as another Gnome.
* If there is a Gnome adjacent to the moving Gnome, the Gnome will always prioritise combining or fighting than moving randomly away.
* If two Gnomes strengths are equal, the attacking Gnome has advantage and kills the other.


Additional features implemented:
* Strength potions
* Bombs
* Editable floor plans
